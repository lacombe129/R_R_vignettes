## Activities to Appraise and Assess Dubious Research Practices

- p-hacking: students work in pairs to explore the potential problems that arise when a non-ethical process is used to determine what to publish. This activity utilizes an interactive website created by Five Thirty Eight.
- multiple comparisons: simulation of a flawed two-stage strategy for determination of the predictors in a multiple regression model.
