## Activities to Appraise and Assess Dubious Research Practices

It's important that students can identify, compare, and contrast dubious practices that may be hidden in a researcherâ€™s approach/methods.
This includes being able to make sense of a world of nulls and p-values, the impact of large samples, and the effect of multiple tests and/or high dimensionality.
To help students be able to assess the potential impacts of dubious practices, such as Type I and Type II errors in statistical modeling, conflating different measures of performance (significance, predictive performance, effect size/coefficient), over-fitting of models, and extrapolation error they need practice in settings where dubious practices are introduced.
Students can deepen their understanding of reproducibility practices by generating spurious conclusions from data in settings where the truth is known, then scrutinize and reflect upon these approaches.

- **p-hacking**: students work in pairs to explore the potential problems that arise when a non-ethical process is used to determine what to publish. This activity utilizes an interactive website created by Five Thirty Eight.
- **multiple comparisons**: students simulate a flawed two-stage strategy for determination of what predictors to include in a multiple linear regression model.
