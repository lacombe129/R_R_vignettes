## Hack your way to scientific glory

During the course, we have learned about some of the perils of *dubious practices* such as overfitting models, making errors in extrapolation, and ignoring or misinterpreting null results.
While there is not a single way to conduct an analysis, researchers need to be transparent in their decision-making process and acknowledge the limitations behind their research.

Before today's class, you were asked to read the Five Thirty Eight Article "Science Isn’t Broken
It’s just a hell of a lot harder than we give it credit for" (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken).

Today you will be working in pairs to explore the potential problems that arise when a non-ethical process is used to determine what to publish.

You will be working through the interactive visualization "Hack Your Way to Scientific Glory" provided by Five Thirty Eight (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking), playing the role of a social scientist "with a hunch" about the association between who is in office (Republicans vs.\ Democrats) and the state of the economy.

An alternative location for the page can be found at https://web.archive.org/web/20250117051842/http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking.

Your mission is to come up with a set of analytic choices that lead to a "statistically significant" result (e.g, p < 0.05).

### Step 0: appoint a leader and a scribe

- The leader will be the person whose birthday is coming up next. The leader is responsible for organizing work on the activity.
- The scribe will be the other person. The scribe is responsible for writing up the first draft of the submission and working with the leader to submit your report.

```


### Step 1: Determine which party you will be exploring

- If the leader's birthday is an ODD number, you will be fitting models for REPUBLICANS
- If the leader's birthday is an EVEN number, you will be fitting models for DEMOCRATS

### Step 2: Define terms

Once you access the website, you'll need to make some decisions.

- Which politicians do you want to include?
- How do you want to measure economic performance?
- Other options

### Step 3: Is there a relationship?

- What do you conclude about the outcome when more REPUBLICANS/DEMOCRATS are in office?

### Step 4: Is your result significant?

### Step 5: Write up your results

In a brief report (no more than one page, single spaced plus a figure) aimed at an audience of your classmates, summarize your model and your results.
Include a screenshot of the scatterplot and the result.
What do you conclude? 
Be sure to discuss the potential issues of p-hacking and the "Garden of Forking Paths"


### Step 6: Submit your report
