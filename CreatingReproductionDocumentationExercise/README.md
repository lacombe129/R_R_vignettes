## Research Organization

The purpose of this activity is to teach students methods of conducting and documenting statistical projects in ways that ensure all the steps of data processing and analysis they perform are transparent, and all the results they generate are reproducible.

The activity consists of an exercise in which students combine and clean data from two sources, construct tabular and visual summaries of the processed data, and answer several questions about how they interpret their findings.
The steps involved in processing the data and generating the results are intentionally kept very simple; the focus is on the principles and practices that achieve transparency and reproducibility.
The instructions given to students, as well as a complete example of the reproduction documentation a student would submit, are available here.
