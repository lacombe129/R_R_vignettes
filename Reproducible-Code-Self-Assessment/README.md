Self-assessment and peer-assessment assignments can help make student work more reproducible by teaching them to become more reflective about aspects of reproducibility. 
Well-designed assessment-based assignments require students to synthesize aspects of recognizing reproducible and replicable research with aspects of appraising and assessing dubious research practices. 
Self-assessment and peer-assessment give students the chance to develop a greater capacity to identify appreciate reproducible and replicable research, identify problem areas, and to think critically about how to prioritize areas for improvement. 
Effective assessment assignments can help students partition reproducibility concepts into smaller cognitive units, which could increase their recall of core ideas and allow them to put more complex idea into practice. 

This activity uses the idea of reproducible code as a frame for peer-reflection and self-reflection.
